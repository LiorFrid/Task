# Task

* Why did you pick your languages/technologies for the tasks?

I picked for frontend React.js, beacuse it greate platform to implement web application and easy to use instead vanllia JS.
for rest-api I chose NodeJs, really good for small applictions and serve my needs.
* Can you say anything about the behaviour or results of the two traders?

they both doesnt have a lot of assets but trader AS earned more money than trader AO by the end of the day, trader AO lost a lot of money at the start of the day but earned some money on the end of the day.
* Can you say anything about the relation between the two assets?

they both saved their value but asset b is more volatile
* Is there anything else you'd want to implement given more time?

if there is more time I think to implement db to save the data instead calculate it when the server is turned on.
on rest-api maybe add express router.
I would add more styling and more options for the graph visulaition.

instructionts for start the project:
1. extract the files
2. go to rest-api folder and then press npm install and then npm start
3. go to front folder and then press npm install and then npm start.
